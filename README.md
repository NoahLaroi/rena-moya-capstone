# rena-moya-capstone
This is Rena Moya, my capstone for BrainStation. It solves the problem of scheduing for my friend who is an young entrepeneur. 
There are four pages for clients to learn more about her business, see expamples of her artistry, review her policies, and schedule an appointment. The home page can be navigated to by clicking on the Main logo. 
On the schedule page, just type in your information: 

        - Your name.
        - Your phone number.
        - Your desired day.
        - Your desired time.
        - A description of what you want.

All of these form fields must be filled out in order for the appointment to be saved in the server and rendered on the Appointments page which can only be accessed by my friend. 

The Appointments page is only accessible to those with the admin password (123456). On that page the appointments are available to be seen and either canceled or edited.
